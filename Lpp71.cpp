    //1) First, C++ tries to find an exact match.
    //This is the case where the actual argument exactly matches the 
    //parameter type of one of the overloaded functions

    //2) If no exact match is found, 
    //C++ tries to find a match through promotion type conversion and casting,
    //we covered how certain types can be automatically promoted via internal 
    //type conversion to other types

    //Char, unsigned char, and short is promoted to an int.
    //Unsigned short can be promoted to int or unsigned int, depending on the size of an int
    //Float is promoted to double
    //Enum is promoted to int

    //3) If no promotion is possible, 
    //C++ tries to find a match through standard conversion. 
    //Standard conversions include:

    //Any numeric type will match any other numeric type, including unsigned(e.g. int to float)
    //Enum will match the formal type of a numeric type(e.g. enum to float)
    //Zero will match a pointer typeand numeric type(e.g. 0 to char*, or 0 to float)
    //A pointer will match a void pointer

    //4) Finally, C++ tries to find a match through user-defined conversion. 
    //Although we have not covered classes yet, classes (which are similar to structs)
    //can define conversions to other types that can be implicitly applied
    //to objects of that class. For example, 
    //we might define a class X and a user-defined conversion to int.

    // Ambiguous matches

    print(static_cast<unsigned int>('a'));
    //C++ can not find an exact match. 
    //It tries promoting �a� to an int, but there is no print(int) either. 
    //Using a standard conversion, it can convert �a� to both an unsigned int
    //and a floating point value. 
    //Because all standard conversions are considered equal,
    //this is an ambiguous match.

    print(0u);
    //print(0) is similar. 0 is an int, and there is no print(int).
    //It matches both calls via standard conversion.

    print(static_cast<float>(3.14159));
    //print(3.14159) might be a little surprising, 
    //as most programmers would assume it matches print(float). 
    //But remember that all literal floating point values are doubles 
    //unless they have the �f� suffix. 3.14159 is a double, 
    //and there is no print(double). Consequently, 
    //it matches both calls via standard conversion.

    //Ambiguous matches are considered a compile-time error. 
    //Consequently, an ambiguous match needs to be disambiguated before your 
    //program will compile. 
    //There are a few ways to resolve ambiguous matches

    //Conclusion
    //Function overloading can lower a program�s complexity significantly 
    //while introducing very little additional risk. 
    //Although this particular lesson is longand may seem somewhat complex
    //(particularly the matching rules), 
    //in reality function overloading typically works transparentlyand 
    //without any issues.
    //The compiler will flag all ambiguous cases, 
    //and they can generally be easily resolved.
    // Rule: use function overloading to make your program simpler.

    //Best practice is to declare the default argument in the forward declaration 
    //and not in the function definition,
    //as the forward declaration is more likely to be seen by other files 
    //(particularly if it�s in a header file).

    //Default arguments and function overloading
    //Functions with default arguments may be overloaded.
    //void print(std::string string);
    //void print(char ch = ' ')
    //However, it is important to note that optional parameters do 
    //NOT count towards the parameters that make the function unique.
    //Consequently, the following is not allowed:
    //void printValues(int x);
    //void printValues(int x, int y = 20);

    //Default arguments provide a useful mechanism to specify parameters
    //that the user may optionally provide values for. 
    //They are frequently used in C++
