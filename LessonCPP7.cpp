void the_stack_and_heap()
{
    // The heap free memory

    //The memory that a program uses is typically 
    //divided into a few different areas, called segments

    //The code segment (also called a text segment), where the compiled program sits in memory. 
    //The code segment is typically read-only.

    //The bss segment(also called the uninitialized data segment), 
    //where zero - initialized global and static variables are stored.

    //The data segment(also called the initialized data segment), 
    //where initialized globaland static variables are stored.

    //The heap, where dynamically allocated variables are allocated from.
    //The call stack, where function parameters, local variables, 
    //and other function - related information are stored.

    //The heap segment (also known as the “free store”)
    //keeps track of memory used for dynamic memory allocation

    //In C++, when you use the new operator to allocate memory, 
    //this memory is allocated in the application’s heap segment.

    //int* ptr = new int; // ptr is assigned 4 bytes in the heap
    //int* array = new int[10]; // array is assigned 40 bytes in the heap

    //The address of this memory is passed back by operator new, 
    //and can then be stored in a pointer. 
    //You do not have to worry about the mechanics behind the process
    //of how free memory is located and allocated to the user. 
    //However, it is worth knowing that sequential memory requests 
    //may not result in sequential memory addresses being allocated!

    //When a dynamically allocated variable is deleted, 
    //the memory is “returned” to the heap and can then be reassigned
    //as future allocation requests are received. 
    //Remember that deleting a pointer does not delete the variable,
    //it just returns the memory at the associated address back to the 
    //operating system.

    //The heap has advantages and disadvantages:

    //Allocating memory on the heap is comparatively slow.
    //Allocated memory stays allocated until it is specifically deallocated
    //(beware memory leaks) or the application ends
    //(at which point the OS should clean it up).

    //Dynamically allocated memory must be accessed through a pointer.
    //Dereferencing a pointer is slower than accessing a variable directly.
    //Because the heap is a big pool of memory, 
    //large arrays, structures, or classes can be allocated here.

    //The call stack

    //The call stack(usually referred to as “the stack”)
    //has a much more interesting role to play.
    //The call stack keeps track of all the active functions
    //(those that have been called but have not yet terminated) 
    //from the start of the program to the current point of execution, 
    //and handles allocation of all function parametersand local variables.

    //The call stack is implemented as a stack data structure.
    //So before we can talk about how the call stack works, 
    //we need to understand what a stack data structure is.

    //The stack data structure

    //A data structure is a programming mechanism for organizing data 
    //so that it can be used efficiently. 
    //You’ve already seen several types of data structures, 
    //such as arrays and structs.
    //Both of these data structures provide mechanisms for storing data 
    //and accessing that data in an efficient way. 
    //There are many additional data structures that are commonly used in programming,
    //quite a few of which are implemented in the standard library,
    //and a stack is one of those.

    //Consider a stack of plates in a cafeteria. 
    //Because each plate is heavy and they are stacked,
    //you can really only do one of three things:
    
    //1) Look at the surface of the top plate
    //2) Take the top plate off the stack(exposing the one underneath, if it exists)
    //3) Put a new plate on top of the stack(hiding the one underneath, if it exists)

    //In computer programming, 
    //a stack is a container data structure that holds multiple variables 
    //(much like an array). 
    //However, whereas an array lets you access and modify elements in any
    //order you wish (called random access), a stack is more limited.
    //The operations that can be performed on a stack correspond to the
    //three things mentioned above

    //1) Look at the top item on the stack (usually done via a function called top(), 
    //but sometimes called peek())
    //2) Take the top item off of the stack(done via a function called pop())
    //3) Put a new item on top of the stack(done via a function called push())

    //A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure. 
    //The last item pushed onto the stack will be the first item popped off. 
    //If you put a new plate on top of the stack, 
    //the first plate removed from the stack will be the plate you just pushed on last. 
    //Last on, first off. As items are pushed onto a stack, 
    //the stack grows larger -- as items are popped off, the stack grows smaller.
    
    //The plate analogy is a pretty good analogy as to how the call stack works, 
    //but we can make a better analogy. 
    //Consider a bunch of mailboxes, all stacked on top of each other. 
    //Each mailbox can only hold one item, and all mailboxes start out empty. 
    //Furthermore, each mailbox is nailed to the mailbox below it, 
    //so the number of mailboxes can not be changed. 
    //If we can’t change the number of mailboxes, how do we get a stack-like behavior?

    //First, we use a marker (like a post-it note) to keep track of where
    //the bottom-most empty mailbox is. In the beginning, 
    //this will be the lowest mailbox (on the bottom of the stack). 
    //When we push an item onto our mailbox stack, 
    //we put it in the mailbox that is marked (which is the first empty mailbox), 
    //and move the marker up one mailbox. 
    //When we pop an item off the stack, we move the marker down one mailbox 
    //(so it’s pointed at the top non-empty mailbox) and remove the item from that mailbox. 
    //Anything below the marker is considered “on the stack”. 
    //Anything at the marker or above the marker is not on the stack.

    //The call stack segment

    //The call stack segment holds the memory used for the call stack.
    //When the application starts, the main() function is pushed on the call stack
    //by the operating system.Then the program begins executing.

    //When a function call is encountered, the function is pushed onto the call stack.
    //When the current function ends, that function is popped off the call stack.
    //Thus, by looking at the functions pushed on the call stack, 
    //we can see all of the functions that were called to get to the current point 
    //of execution.

    //Our mailbox analogy above is fairly analogous to how the call stack works. 
    //The stack itself is a fixed-size chunk of memory addresses. 
    //The mailboxes are memory addresses, and the “items” we’re
    //pushing and popping on the stack are called stack frames. 
    //A stack frame keeps track of all of the data associated with one function call. 
    //We’ll talk more about stack frames in a bit. The “marker” is a register
    //(a small piece of memory in the CPU) known as the stack pointer 
    //(sometimes abbreviated “SP”). 
    //The stack pointer keeps track of where the top of the call stack currently is.

    //The only difference between our hypothetical mailbox stackand the call stack 
    //is that when we pop an item off the call stack,
    //we don’t have to erase the memory(the equivalent of emptying the mailbox).
    //We can just leave it to be overwritten by the next item pushed to that piece of memory.
    //Because the stack pointer will be below that memory location, 
    //we know that memory location is not on the stack.

    //Typically, it is not important to know all the details about how the call stack works.
    //However, understanding that functions are effectively pushed on the stack
    //when they are called and popped off when they return gives you the fundamentals
    //needed to understand recursion, 
    //as well as some other concepts that are useful when debugging.
    
    //A technical note: on some architectures, 
    //the call stack grows away from memory address 0. On others, 
    //it grows towards memory address 0. As a consequence,
    //newly pushed stack frames may have a higher or a lower memory address 
    //than the previous ones.

    //Stack overflow

    //The stack has a limited size, 
    //and consequently can only hold a limited amount of information.On Windows, 
    //the default stack size is 1MB.On some unix machines, 
    //it can be as large as 8MB.If the program tries to put too much information
    //on the stack, stack overflow will result.Stack overflow happens when all
    //the memory in the stack has been allocated -- in that case, 
    //further allocations begin overflowing into other sections of memory.

    //Stack overflow is generally the result of allocating too many variables on the stack,
    //and /or making too many nested function calls
    //(where function A calls function B calls function C calls function D etc…)
    //On modern operating systems, overflowing the stack will generally
    //cause your OS to issue an access violationand terminate the program.

    //int stack[10000000];
    //std::cout << "hi";
    //This program tries to allocate a huge (likely 40MB) array on the stack. 
    //Because the stack is not large enough to handle this array,
    //the array allocation overflows into portions of memory the program
    //is not allowed to use.

    //void foo()
    //{
    //    foo();
    //}   
 
    //int main()
    //{
    //    foo();
    //    return 0;
    //}

    //In the above program, 
    //a stack frame is pushed on the stack every time function foo() is called. 
    //Since foo() calls itself infinitely, 
    //eventually the stack will run out of memory and cause an overflow.

    //The stack has advantagesand disadvantages:

    //Allocating memory on the stack is comparatively fast.
    //Memory allocated on the stack stays in scope as long as it is on the stack.
    //It is destroyed when it is popped off the stack.
    //All memory allocated on the stack is known at compile time.
    //Consequently, this memory can be accessed directly through a variable.
    //Because the stack is relatively small, 
    //it is generally not a good idea to do anything that eats up lots of stack space.
    //This includes passing by value or creating local variables of large arrays
    //or other memory - intensive structures.
